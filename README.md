Tennis Sport Details

This project is built to collect and show detailed information about tennis matches and players from competitions around the world. It uses the SportRadar API to pull real-time data like player names, match results, and tournament details.

The user interface is made with Streamlit, which helps display the data in a clean and simple way. Users can easily search and filter the information based on things like player name, rank, type, gender, city, country, or points threshold. The goal is to make it easy for anyone,whether a tennis fan or a data lover,to explore and understand the world of tennis.
